We use python for machine learrning .
Why so?


The reasons are listed below:-
1. Python is very easy to use: Its libraries make it a perfect match for learning new operations and Also AI/ML/DL
2.Python has multiple libraries and Frameworks which can be used by a developer to perform various operations.
     Python libraries: 
           (a) NumPy : Used to create multidimentional arrays and perform different operations on those arrays
           (b) Pandas : Out of different data items and data files , Panda libraries are used to perform different operations on Those data sets
           (c) SeaBorn : It includes some statistical analysis within their libraries and also to visualize the datasets and perform statistical analysis within those datasets
           (d)SkykitsLearn: This is the library which is widely accepted and known to be most suitable for ML
    Python Frameworks: Used for situating neural networks in Deep learning
           (a)Tensor Flow
           (b) Keras
           (c)PYtorch
3. Community and Coorporate support.~
